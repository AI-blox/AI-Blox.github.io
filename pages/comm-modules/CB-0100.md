## Description

The CB-0100 module adds WiFi/BT to the BLOX platform. It makes the module ideal for projects where local wireless communication like WiFi and/or BT is required. 

The WiFi modem supports the 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards and has both the 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands to allow data transfer up to 150Mbps for both receive and transmit. Additionally the modem also supports the BT 4.0 standard. Both WiFi and BT can be used simultaneously and have separate antennas.
