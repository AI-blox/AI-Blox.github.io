## Description

The CB-0110 module adds both WiFi/BT and Gigabit Ethernet to the BLOX platform with the combination of a 100Mbps/1Gbps ethernet port and a WiFi/BT modem. It makes the module ideal for projects where wireless communication like WiFi or BT and gigabit ethernet network are required. 

The WiFi modem supports the 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards and has both the 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands to allow data transfer up to 150Mbps for both receive and transmit. Additionally the modem also supports the BT 4.0 standard. Both WiFi and BT can be used simultaneously and have separate antennas.
