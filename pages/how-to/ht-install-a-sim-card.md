# Introduction

The [CB-0200](/pages/comm-modules/CB-0200.html) and [CB-0210](/pages/comm-modules/CB-0210.html) communication modules have an internal LTE Cat. 4 modem. 
This modem needs a SIM card to register itselves to a cellular network. This how-to describes the steps to take to install the SIM card into the BLOX device.

# Prerequisites
