## Description

This module can be used in applications where USB3.0 is required and some input/output interfacing is necessary.
The module has 4 USB3.0 standard-A ports and has an internal USB3.0 hub controller on the module which support following speed modes:
* Super Speed (SS) - 5 Gbps
* High Speed (HS) - 480 Mbps
* Full Speed (FS) - 12 Mbps
* Low Speed (LS) - 1.5 Mbps

This allows you to stream up to 4 cameras in high resolution and a high frame rate. All ports are backwards compatible with USB2.0.

The module has also 4 Digital Outputs (DO) and 4 Digital Inputs (DI).
Both are 24VDC compatible and are optical isolated from the BLOX device.
Those I/O can used to interface with a remote system such as a PLC system.

</p>

The above diagram shows the block diagram of the interface module. There are 3 main parts:
* USB3.0 Hub 
* Digital Output circuits
* Digital Input circuits

The USB3.0 Hub is connected to the BLOX USB3.0 port. 
This way, the BLOX USB3.0 port is extended with 4 USB3.0 ports P1...P4.

The digital outputs and inputs are galvanic isolated from the BLOX. 
This allows you to use 2 different power supplies: one for the BLOX (24VDC) and the other for the I/O (24VDC I/O).
