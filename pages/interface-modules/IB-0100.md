## Description

The IB-0100 allows you to connect up to 6 MIPI cameras to the BLOX device. 

The maximum number of cameras depends on the Jetson Module: 
* Jetson Nano: up to 3 cameras
* Jetson TX2 NX and the Jetson Xavier NX: up to 6 cameras

The module also has a USB3.0 port to connect USB devices like an SSD drive or keyboard/mouse.

## Camera support

Currently the module supports the IMX219 camera, [here](/pages/interface-modules/6-channel-mipi/imx219.html) you can find out how you can use the camera on the BLOX platform.

If you need an other camera, please contact us at [support](mailto:support@ai-blox.com?subject=[Docs]%20Camera%20driver%20request) and we are happy check if we can provide a driver.

The above diagram shows the block diagram of the interface module. 

There is a USB3.0 port that can be used to connect USB devices like an SSD drive or keyboard/mouse.

There are in total 6 FPC connectors for connecting the cameras. 
Each camera has it's own 2-lane MIPI channel and is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 15 pin camera connector.
