## Description

The IB-0100 allows you to connect up to 6 MIPI cameras to the BLOX device. 

The maximum number of cameras depends on the Jetson Module: 
* Jetson Nano: up to 3 cameras
* Jetson TX2 NX and the Jetson Xavier NX: up to 6 cameras

The module has also a USB3.0 port to connect external USB devices like an SSD drive or keyboard/mouse.

## Camera support

Currently the module supports the IMX219 camera, [here](/pages/interface-modules/6-channel-mipi/imx219.html) you can find out how you can use the camera on the BLOX platform.

If you need an other camera, please contact us at [support](mailto:support@ai-blox.com?subject=[Docs]%20Camera%20driver%20request) and we are happy check if we can provide a driver.

</p>

The above diagram shows the block diagram of the interface module. At the top, we have 3 connectors:
* Power connector for powering the BLOX device
* Serial connector for connecting the boot terminal 
* USB connector for flashing the BLOX device

There is an button on the module, which allows you to place the BLOX in recovery mode.
When the device is in recovery mode, you can flash the Jetson module through the USB.

There are in total 6 FPC connectors for connecting the cameras. 
Those connectors are compatible with the Raspberry Pi camera connector. 
Each camera has it's own 2-lane MIPI channel.

### CAM 0 to CAM 5 port 

The connector type used on the module is the [1-1734248-5](https://www.te.com/usa-en/product-1-1734248-5.html?te_campaign=oct_glo_manufacturer&elqCampaignId=26136&te_bu=Cor&te_type=other) connector from TE Connectivity.

The connector is pin compatible with the Raspbery Pi camera connector.
